# SkyLink 

This is a mobile app called “Skylink” is created to enable long range P2P wireless communication between Android devices, in scenarios where both cellphone network and WiFi connectivity are absent.

“Skylink” uses Low Energy Bluetooth (BLE) to pair an Android device with an Arduino Microcontroller that functions as transceiver for LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area) communications, to exchange text messages with an Android device with its own Arduino LoRa-BLE tranceiver on the other end.

This app is to be presented as the final project for the Architect Coders Android bootcamp by DevExpert.io, 2024.
