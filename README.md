# SkyLink 

This mobile app called “Skylink” enables long range P2P wireless communication between Android devices, in scenarios where both the cellphone network and WiFi connectivity is absent.

“Skylink” uses Low Energy Bluetooth (BLE) to pair an Android device with an Arduino Microcontroller that functions as transceiver for LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area) communications, to exchange text messages with an Android device on the other end.
